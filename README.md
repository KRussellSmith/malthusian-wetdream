I was bored last night, and it occured to me I hadn't yet tried to create a snake game,
which I remember fearing would be too complicated for me,
way back when I started to learn programming **7 years ago**.

This was a fairly mindless project; the code pretty much speaks for itself.

A pretty minimalistic take the concept â€” I was bored, not trying to create the _Hagia Sophia_ of snake games.

**Instructions:**
-----
  * Swipe the screen to change the snake's direction.
  * Eat fish (blue squares) to grow and earn points.
  * Tap to restart when you lose.
